MemoPad was built using the Spring Boot on the backend and Angular on the frontend. Our database of choice was postgres, but any compatible with Spring Boot JDA will work.

For the sake of convenience, we use Docker to create official MemoPad images that you can use to run the app without needing to build it your self. A docker-compose file is also provided, which you can use to quickly set it up with minimal configuration required.
